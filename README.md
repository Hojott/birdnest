# Birdnest
Reaktor pre-assignment for tracking drone violations. Made without Python and HTML.

Runs on https://kussi.fi/birdnest, but you can start a dev server with:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python src/wsgi.py

Also includes a small cli main.py, but it isn't linked to the database and works only real-time.
I have also included the docker-compose.yml file I used on my server.
